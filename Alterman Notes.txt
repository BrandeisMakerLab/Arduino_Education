makerspace for programming
review article
a review of university maker spaces

HOW ARE ONLINE MAKERSPACES DESIGNED?
look at literature
collaborative space?
	if so, is it same time, different place? different time, 
	differnet place?
cooperative space?
	like scratch?
	scratch, but for electronics
what is the larger context (part of blended class)?
(face to face, online, what would online piece be?)
Is this online or physical or both?
	physical +technology
Motive for background research
	survey what's out there
	identify more interesting stuff

DESIGN
	paper prototype
	slide presentation
DELIVERABLE
	build something that people will use
	they will use it to support them
	Why can't I do this with a textbook
		software platform is more interactive, people will learn more
		lecture hall, lecture, homework
		but we don't do that anymore
				
11:56 AM, met with Professor Alterman, calling 11:10 AM start today
	This meeting helped me pitch my electronics workshop
	It really is an electronics applciation to introductory computer science, 
		that's where my motive is
	It looks like Professor ALterman's specialty is integrating technology into education,
	so if I want to design an app or website to convey the curriculum I can do that
		maybe have live feedback for programs
