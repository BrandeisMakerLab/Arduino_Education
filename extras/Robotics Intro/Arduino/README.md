# Introduction to Arduino
"Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software." (As said from the Arduino Introduction page).
In other words, Arduino is a user-friendly software and allows for people who haven't applied their coding abilities to interact with the
real world via basic electronics. To those who have not coded at all, do not fret, because the examples and community make it very easy to
get momentum to eventually start making your own projects.  
  
There are two purposes to the creation of the Arduino section in our repository:  
* *To introduce newcomers of the MakerLab to Arduino.* Most things will be done step by step in here or "Basics" until the user is ready
to start his or her own project. Procedures will be documented in detail to avoid users from having to search things up by themselves.
We would like for non-technologically savvy people to get the opportunity to learn Arduino from scratch here, if possible.
* *To upload projects.* All projects by the MakerLab organization as well as Deis Robotics will be developed and put onto the "Projects"
folder.

## Installation Procedures for the IDE
Firstly, visit this website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software  
You should see a section where it says "Download the Arduino IDE." In the blue box on the right, click whichever system you have and 
click "Just Download" (or if you want to contribute to this fantastic community, "Contribute & Download").   
  
**Windows**  
For Windows, it should just be straight forward and you can proceed to install with the default configurations. If you do run into
trouble, consult with this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows  
  
**Mac OSX**  
For Mac, see this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX  
  
If you have your IDE installed and running, go into the "Basics" folder.
