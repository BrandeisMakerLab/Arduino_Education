# Projects

These files combine two of the example files to make a small project. One example is a combination of the printDistance and blikn programs to make a device that blinks and LED when something is close to the distance sensor.

These files can be used as a reference for people creating their own projects. It is recommended to make one's one combined file from two example files, then check it against the example here.
